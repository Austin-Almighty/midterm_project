# Interactive Truchet Tile Physics Toy

This is an interactive art project that combines the beauty of hexagonal Truchet tiles with a playful 2D physics simulation. Drop shapes, manipulate gravity, and control the wind to create your own dynamic visual compositions.

## Live Demo

[Link to live demo will be here]

## Features

*   **Interactive Physics:** Drop shapes and watch them tumble through a complex, rotating environment.
*   **Generative Patterns:** The hexagonal tile grid creates ever-changing paths and patterns.
*   **Dynamic Effects:** See sparks fly on collision and watch electricity arc across the tiles.
*   **Full Control:** Manipulate the simulation with controls for gravity and wind.

## Controls

*   **Mouse Click:** Drop the currently selected shape.
*   **'s' key:** Switch between shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle).
*   **'g' key:** Cycle through gravity modes (normal, reversed, strong).
*   **Arrow Keys:** Apply a continuous wind force in all four directions.
*   **SPACE key:** Reset the entire simulation with a new random color scheme.
